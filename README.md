## Contribute
You can contribute to YouTube Center by different means. You can help find bugs (and report them in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/wlmyaps/YouTubeCenter/issues)), help with the translation to different languages or you can try and implement new things yourself.

### Translation
YouTube Center uses Crowdin to better manage the translations. If you want to help with the translation of YouTube Center you can find the project page on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.net/project/youtube-center).

## Build
YouTube Center is using the build system [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/).

### Base requirements (you don't need these to run the extension)
 * Desktop Computer
 * [Java SDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
 * [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/)

### Optional requirements
To build the Chrome or Maxthon extension it is required to be able to run executable, which can be done in Wine on Linux or on a Windows computer.

It is possible to build the unpacked version of the Chrome or Maxthon extension without the need to run executables:
 * `ant copy-chrome` -- Makes the required files to build the extension file (.crx) ready in the build directory.
 * `ant copy-maxthon` -- Makes the required files to build the extension file (.mxaddon) ready in the build directory.

### Signing
The certificates for signing the extensions have to be provided by yourself and have to be placed in:
 * `/.cert/chrome/`
 * `/.cert/safari/`
 
It should be noted that the Ant build will create a new signing key for Chrome if it's missing from `/.cert/chrome/` (Running executables is required).
 
### Ant
The build system is made in Ant and requires both Ant and Java to be installed.

 * `ant all` -- Build everything below except for the styles.
 * `ant devnumber` -- Increment the build number.
 * `ant firefox` -- Build the Firefox addon (.xpi)
 * `ant chrome` -- Build the Chrome extension (.crx)
 * `ant maxthon` -- Build the Maxthon extension (.mxaddon)
 * `ant opera` -- Build the Opera extension (.oex)
 * `ant userscript` -- Build the userscript (.user.js)
 * `ant safari` -- Makes everything ready for Safari to finish building YouTube Center.
 * `ant styles` -- Minifies the styles used. This is needed to be called everytime a change in the styles is made.
 * `ant language` -- Retrieves the newest translations for YouTube Center and stores it as a JSON file.
